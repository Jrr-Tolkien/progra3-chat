Frontend and backend code for a chatroom
In order to make it work, config.js must be modified (add the mongodb connection string)
This project saves its messages on a data base(mongose), lets you talk on real time using sockects.
Stuff used:
-HTML (part of the frontend)
-Javascript (functions for the frontend)
-JQuery (in order to use the post, get facilities, and others)
-NodeJS (backend and routes)
-Bootstrap (to make it a bit prettier and responsive)
-CSS (to modify a bit the Bootstrap code)

To test it you just have to go to this direction(endpoint) once you run it on your end or a servers end.
